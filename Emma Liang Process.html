			<p>Pinterest was a great way to find similar design styles and website layouts in order to get a general idea of what I wanted the final website to look like. I was able to discover design choices that I thought resonated with my vision of what the overall webpage would ressemble, taking an overall more minimalist approach to the design and incorporating alot of block lettering and figures to the overall layout. I also wanted to incorporate a lot of blue since it is my favourite colour, and gives a more mellow and cool tone to the website.</p>

			<br>
			<p> The next milestone involved using the design platform Canva to generate a more detailed version of the website's final design. I could experiment with the many components and layouts to create the general concept and style that I wanted. To create a more contemporary and minimalistic overall design for the website, I used a blue-coloured theme and used various block letter styles and elements. This stage was important since it allowed me to compare the coded HTML pages from Adobe Dreamweaver to the final webpage look by using the Canva design as a reference point/instruction guideline.</p>

		<p id="accessibility-cite">WCAG 2.0 Accessibility</p>
		<p>This section summarizes how the website abides by WCAG 2.0 by implementing several accessibility measures in order to increase the overall usability of the website for different users. 
		<br>
		<br>
		When designing the webpage, I wanted to ensure that the website ensures adequate color contrast between text and background elements to enhance readability for users with visual impairments. It follows WCAG guidelines, which recommend a minimum color contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text (W3C, n.d.). For the header and main body of each webpage, we can see that the mix of darker blue tones and different shades of white surpass the minimum contrast ratio recommended by WCAG 2.0. By adhering to these contrast ratios, the website ensures that text content is easily distinguishable for users with low vision or color blindness. 
		<br>	
		<br>	
		Using simple font types and sizes to accommodate users with visual impairments or reading difficulties can also make the website more accessible for a wider audience. I went with using clear and legible font styles that enhance readability, sticking with a sans serif font for the body paragraphs and a seperate font for the headers and page titles. Using considerably large font sizes also allows for greater readability for the user while browsing through the different pages, with the body paragraph sections following a minimum size of 12 points and the footer a minimum of size 9 points (W3C, n.d.). 
		<br>	
		<br>	
		I also incorporated alt text for all of the images throughout the website, as it allows users to be able to access the information conveyed by each photo or image, regardless of their given accessibility or technical limitiations. All of these measures ensure a smoother and easier navigational journey, regardless of how or where the user decides to interact with the webpage.</p>
